Step23: Unified pipeline for cell sampling, growth, mixing, and analysis.

This module combines the functionality of steps 2 and 3 into a single
streamlined pipeline that processes cells from year 50 to year 60,
creating three comparison groups:
- Mutant: Decile-based sampling, grown and mixed
- Control1: Uniform sampling, grown and mixed  
- Control2: Pure year 60 samples
